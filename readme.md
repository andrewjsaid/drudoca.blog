# Dru's Delirium and Other Coding Antics

This project is an attempt to solve two birds with one stone; finally getting a website up and running
whilst simultaneously exploring ASP.NET Core 3.1.

## Goals

1. To create a modern fully-async blog with a minimal feature set.
2. To explore .NET Core and ASP.NET Core.
3. To integrate wtih various tools to provide continuous integration and deployment.
4. To have fun doing so.
