# Drudoca Blog

This project is a blogging platform developed for personal use. The goal is to have an extensible platform on which multiple websites could be based, not just my own.

## Setup

The application is kept up to date on docker image andrewjsaid/drudoca and is deployed nightly to https://andrewjsaid.com.

The deployment is handled through `docker-compose` and cron jobs which update the site and content on a nightly basis.
